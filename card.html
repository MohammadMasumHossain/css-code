                    <P> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes
                        code readability with the
                        use of significant indentation.[31]

                        Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                        including structured
                        (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as
                        a "batteries included"
                        language due to its comprehensive standard library.</P>
