        New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of
        two
        main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller
        islands. It
        is the sixth-largest island country by area and lies east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and south of the
        islands of
        New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern
        Alps,
        owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most
        populous city
        is Auckland.

        The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land to be settled by humans. Between about 1280 and
        1350,
        Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch
        explorer
        Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United
        Kingdom
        and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which in its English version declared British sovereignty over
        the
        islands. In 1841, New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire. Subsequently, a series of conflicts
        between the
        colonial government and Māori tribes resulted in the alienation and confiscation of large amounts of Māori land.
        New
        Zealand became a dominion in 1907; it gained full statutory independence in 1947, retaining the monarch as head
        of
        state. Today, the majority of New Zealand's population of 5.25 million is of European descent; the indigenous
        Māori are
        the largest minority, followed by Asians and Pacific Islanders. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly
        derived
        from Māori and early British settlers, with recent broadening of culture arising from increased immigration. The
        official languages are English, Māori, and New Zealand Sign Language, with the local dialect of English being
        dominant.
